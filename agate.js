                Dear diary,
                <br><br>
                Earlier this afternoon, I arrived in Monterey to live with <span class="tooltip">Zia<span class="tooltiptext">Sicilian for maternal aunt. Pronounced "tsia"</span></span> and her family. I must say, after living in Salinas for the past
                few years, I was surprised by the amount of bustle in what I had assumed to be a simple fishing town. Of course, I had heard that the canneries had attracted immigrants from all over the world (especially my own Sicilian people) but I was
                completely unprepared huge variety of foreign cultures, dress, and speech that I saw around me. 
                <br><br>
                I myself was drawn to live here with Zia Cecilia and family so I could work in the canneries. They say the Sicilian community is stronger here than anywhere else in California, and after Papa's death it 
                would be comforting to surround myself with my own people. 
                <br><br>
                Already, Signora Russo, Zia Cecilia's friend, managed to get me a job at <a href="" class="discover">San Carlos</a> through a friend and has already promised to send her niece over
                when the <a href="" class="discover">cannery whistles</a> call in the morning. Apparently the sardine catches come in at very unpredictable times but when they do, everybody knows because the whistles can be heard 
                screaming across town.
                <br><br>
                Anyhow, I ought to go to sleep now if I am to be rested tomorrow. Goodnight!
                <br><br>
                Sincerely,
                <br>

                    Zia Cecilia was right. It is not even daylight when the shrill, single-toned screaming of the cannery whistles are heard across town.
                    However, after spending two years as a field hand, stooping for hours the hot sun to pick fruit in order to support myself and my "sick" father, 
                    the opportunity for change is cause enough for excitement. 
                    <br><br>
                    After dressing, I rush into the kitchen where Zia Cecilia has already arisen and is making a pot of hot coffee. However, I have hardly entered the room when 
                    I hear a knock at the door.
                    <br><br>
                    Arising quickly, I go to open it. On the doorstep stands a girl about my age wearing a staunch white apron, black rubber gloves, and a dark hair staunchly kept back in a hair net.
                    Held close to her chest is another similar outfit.

                    I long to talk to some of the girls again, but turning to Carmela, she is clearly immersed in her task, fingers deftly cutting one fish after another.
                    A quick glance at the other girls shows the rest of them to be just as absorbed in their mind-numbing tasks. Other than the roar of machinery, the barking orders by Signora
                    Santoro (primarily towards the Mexican and Spanish girls), and the yelling of men working the machines, not a sound is to be heard.

                    Despite the fact that everyone seems to be concentrated on their job, I feel that I am going to scream if I have to sit in silence a moment longer. A quick glance over 
                    my shoulder shows that Sonora Santoro is far away, lurking over the shoulders of girls across the room. The coast is clear . . . should I try and start a conversation?
