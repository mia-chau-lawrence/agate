              <p>
                Sicilian immigrants have left a lasting impact on the history and culture of Monterey, California. 
                Their expertise in fishing and canning helped transform Monterey into the "Sardine Capital of the World," making it one of the most important fishing ports in the United States.
                <br><br>
                Along with their fishing skills, Sicilian immigrants brought their rich cultural heritage to Monterey and 
                established a strong, supportive community within Monterey.
                <br><br>
                However, this close-knit community inevitably had its drawbacks. 
                By holding so tightly to their cultural roots, Sicilian immigrants tended to be exclusive of other immigrant populations in Monterey.
                <br><br>
                Inadvertantly, the Sicilian community's strong influence over the fishing industry made it difficult for other ethnic groups to gain a foothold in the field. 
                This lack of diversity ultimately hindered the creation of a cannery union for over a decade.
